# BertSum

**This code is for paper `Fine-tune BERT for Extractive Summarization`**(https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.10318.pdf)

**!New: Please see our [full paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.08345) with trained models**

I have tried to add sentence syntactical features along with BERT sentence embedding before they are send into inter-sentence transformer layer.

For generating the Syntactical Features use notebook, PrepareSyntacticalFeatures.ipynb

For Training and Validating the extended model use Notebook TrainNotebook.ipynb and ValidateNotebook.ipynb present inside src folder
